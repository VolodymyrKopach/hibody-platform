### System Prompt

The AI is instructed to:
1. Act as an educational content specialist
2. Consider age group and content mode
3. Ask clarifying questions
4. Generate comprehensive topic descriptions
5. Mark final topics with "TOPIC_READY:" prefix

### Topic Detection

When AI generates a final topic, it includes:
```
TOPIC_READY: [complete topic description]
```

The API parses this marker and:
- Extracts the topic text
- Removes the marker from displayed response
- Returns `generatedTopic` in response
- Enables "Use This Topic" button in dialog

### Token Tracking

The API automatically tracks token usage for authenticated users:
- Service: `worksheet_topic_generation`
- Model: `gemini-2.5-flash`
- Tracks input, output, and total tokens
- Stored in Supabase for analytics and monitoring
