**SLIDE DESCRIPTION:**
${slideDescription}

**CONTEXT:**
- Lesson topic: ${topic}
- Target audience: children aged ${age}

**AGE-SPECIFIC COMPONENT EXAMPLES:**
Use the following component examples as reference for creating appropriate visual elements:

${ageTemplate}

${this.getAgeSpecificComponentGuidance(age)}

**TEMPLATE USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:**
- Study the styles and components from the example above
- Choose 3-5 components that match your slide's learning objectives
- Adapt the design to your content while maintaining age-appropriate complexity
- Use similar colors, fonts, and sizes as shown in the template
