**LESSON PLAN CONTENT INTEGRATION:**
- Seamlessly integrate age-appropriate interactive elements into slide content descriptions
- Naturally weave teaching approaches and activities based on the component guidance above
- Consider cognitive load and attention span appropriate for ${age} year olds
- Balance interactive elements with content delivery for optimal learning
- Plan for progressive difficulty and complexity across slides
- Ensure teaching methods align with educational goals and developmental stage
- Write content descriptions that educators can directly implement without technical jargon
${this.getAgeSpecificPlanningGuidance(age)}

IMPORTANT:
- STRICTLY follow the structure "### Slide X: [Title]"
- Generate EXACTLY ${slideCount} slides as requested
- Each slide must contain detailed description (minimum 100 words)
- Adapt content for age ${age}
- Include interactive elements naturally within content descriptions
- Make the lesson engaging and educational
- DO NOT include duration or time information in slide titles (e.g. use "Introduction" not "Introduction (5 minutes)")
- Write content descriptions in natural, educational language that teachers can follow
- Integrate component recommendations seamlessly into teaching suggestions rather than as technical specifications
- Focus on pedagogical approaches and student engagement rather than technical implementation details

CRITICAL TEXT-ONLY RULES:
- ALL content in the lesson plan MUST contain ONLY PLAIN TEXT
- NO HTML tags, NO markup, NO code, NO IMAGE_PROMPT comments
- Use descriptive language about educational activities, not technical specifications
- Example GOOD: "Children will explore different animal sounds by listening to audio clips and imitating the sounds together"
- Example BAD: "<div class='animal-sounds'><audio controls>animal.mp3</audio></div>"
- Remember: Content = Educational Description, NOT HTML Code`;

**TASK:** Create a complete HTML slide for children aged ${age} based on the description.

**SLIDE DESCRIPTION:**
${slideDescription}

**CONTEXT:**
- Lesson topic: ${topic}
- Target audience: children aged ${age}
- Content Language: ${contentLanguage}

**IMPORTANT LANGUAGE GUIDELINES:**
- Generate ALL user-facing content (titles, instructions, text for children) in ${contentLanguage}
- Keep system content (image prompts, alt attributes, CSS classes, data attributes) in English
- Example: data-image-prompt="happy cartoon cow in green meadow" (ENGLISH)
- Example: alt="cartoon cow" (ENGLISH)
- Example: <h1>–ö–æ—Ä—ñ–≤–∫–∞ –∫–∞–∂–µ –ú–£!</h1> (content in ${contentLanguage})

**AGE-SPECIFIC COMPONENT EXAMPLES:**
Use the following component examples as reference for creating appropriate visual elements:

${ageTemplate}

${componentMappingService.generateAIInstructions(this.mapAgeToAgeGroup(age))}

**TEMPLATE USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:**
- Study the styles and components from the example above
- Choose 3-5 components that match your slide's learning objectives
- Adapt the design to your content while maintaining age-appropriate complexity
- Use similar colors, fonts, and sizes as shown in the template
- Repeat interactive patterns (hover effects, animations)
- Maintain button and interface element styles
- Always include at least one self-assessment or validation component

**TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
1. Create a COMPLETE HTML document with <!DOCTYPE html>
2. Use CSS-in-style for all styling
3. Add JavaScript for interactivity
4. Format: 4:3 (800x600px or similar)
5. Large, readable fonts for children
6. Bright colors and attractive design

**IMAGE GENERATION:**
INSTEAD of adding real images, use SPECIAL COMMENTS for each place where an image is needed:

**IMAGE COMMENT FORMAT:**
<!-- IMAGE_PROMPT: "detailed image description in English" WIDTH: XXX HEIGHT: YYY -->

**STANDARDIZED IMAGE SIZES:**
Use these EXACT standardized sizes based on image type and context:

**HERO IMAGES (Main slide visuals):**
- Ages 2-3: WIDTH: 640 HEIGHT: 480
- Ages 4-6: WIDTH: 640 HEIGHT: 480  
- Ages 7-8: WIDTH: 800 HEIGHT: 600
- Ages 9-10: WIDTH: 800 HEIGHT: 600

**CONTENT IMAGES (Supporting illustrations):**
- Ages 2-3: WIDTH: 512 HEIGHT: 384
- Ages 4-6: WIDTH: 512 HEIGHT: 384
- Ages 7-8: WIDTH: 640 HEIGHT: 480
- Ages 9-10: WIDTH: 640 HEIGHT: 480

**ACTIVITY IMAGES (Interactive elements):**
- Ages 2-3: WIDTH: 400 HEIGHT: 400 (square format)
- Ages 4-6: WIDTH: 400 HEIGHT: 400 (square format)
- Ages 7-8: WIDTH: 512 HEIGHT: 512 (square format)
- Ages 9-10: WIDTH: 512 HEIGHT: 512 (square format)

**DECORATION IMAGES (Small visual elements):**
- Ages 2-3: WIDTH: 256 HEIGHT: 256
- Ages 4-6: WIDTH: 256 HEIGHT: 256
- Ages 7-8: WIDTH: 320 HEIGHT: 320
- Ages 9-10: WIDTH: 320 HEIGHT: 320

**IMAGE RULES:**
1. ALWAYS use the standardized sizes above - NO custom dimensions
2. Choose the appropriate size category based on image purpose:
   - Hero: Main slide illustration, central visual
   - Content: Supporting educational illustration  
   - Activity: Interactive game elements, clickable items
   - Decoration: Small visual accents, icons, borders
3. Prompt MUST be in English
4. Prompt should be detailed and describe:
   - What is depicted
   - Style (cartoon, illustration, realistic)
   - Colors and mood
   - Age group (for children aged X-Y)
   - Educational purpose

**STANDARDIZED EXAMPLES:**
<!-- IMAGE_PROMPT: "colorful cartoon illustration of happy children counting numbers 1 to 10, bright colors, educational style, for children aged 6-8" WIDTH: 640 HEIGHT: 480 -->
<!-- IMAGE_PROMPT: "cute animated animals learning mathematics, cartoon style, bright and friendly, educational illustration for kids aged 4-6" WIDTH: 512 HEIGHT: 384 -->
<!-- IMAGE_PROMPT: "simple geometric shapes in vibrant colors, educational poster style, clean and child-friendly design for ages 7-8" WIDTH: 400 HEIGHT: 400 -->
<!-- IMAGE_PROMPT: "small decorative star with sparkles, golden color, reward symbol for children aged 2-3" WIDTH: 256 HEIGHT: 256 -->

**COMMENT PLACEMENT:**
- Place comments where images should appear in the layout
- DO NOT add placeholder divs after IMAGE_PROMPT comments - images will be inserted automatically
- Example placement:
  <!-- IMAGE_PROMPT: "description" WIDTH: 640 HEIGHT: 480 -->
- The system will automatically replace this comment with a properly contained image

**MANDATORY ELEMENTS:**
- Slide title
- Main content according to description
- MINIMUM 1-2 images via IMAGE_PROMPT comments
- Minimum 2-3 interactive elements (buttons, animations, games)
- Navigation or action buttons
- Tablet responsiveness

**MANDATORY IMAGE USAGE:**
- Each slide MUST contain at least 1 image
- For educational slides add 2-3 images
- Images must be relevant to the content
- Use images to illustrate key concepts
- Place images logically in the layout

**DESIGN STYLE:**
- Child-friendly, bright, welcoming
- Large buttons and touch elements
- Animations and visual effects
- Game elements appropriate to age

**INTERACTIVITY:**
- Buttons with hover effects
- Click animations
- Interaction possibilities (drag&drop, click, hover)
- Sound effects using Web Audio API or built-in audio toggle system

**RESPONSE STRUCTURE:**
Provide only the ready HTML code without any explanations. The code must be completely self-contained and ready for immediate use.

**AUDIO IMPLEMENTATION:**
- DO NOT use external audio URLs (soundjay.com, freesound.org, etc.)
- Use Web Audio API for sound generation with this pattern:
  - Create playSound function that checks audioEnabled first
  - Use AudioContext to generate tones with different frequencies
  - Wrap in try-catch for browser compatibility
  - Example frequencies: success (523.25), click (440), error (220)
- Include audio toggle system from templates (audioEnabled variable, toggleAudio function)
- Always wrap audio calls with audioEnabled check
- Use different frequencies for different sounds (success: 523.25, click: 440, error: 220)

**CRITICAL AUDIO RULES:**
- DO NOT add manual speak() calls to onclick handlers
- The template functions (handleImageClick, handleGiantButton, etc.) already include appropriate audio
- NEVER combine manual speak() with template functions like: onclick="handleImageClick(this,'activity'); speak('Car!')"
- Use ONLY the template functions: onclick="handleImageClick(this,'activity')" 
- If you need custom text, pass it as parameter to the function, not as separate speak() call
- Template functions already handle all audio timing and prevent conflicts

**ATTENTION:** 
- DO NOT use external libraries (jQuery, Bootstrap, etc.)
- DO NOT use external audio files or URLs
- DO NOT use <a href> tags or any navigation links
- DO NOT create buttons with href attributes
- Use <div> elements with onclick handlers instead of <a> tags
- All styles - inline or in <style> section
- All JavaScript - in <script> section
- Ready for immediate display in browser`;
