## API Changes

### Data Structure (No Breaking Changes)
```typescript
// Data structure remains the same
interface DraggableItem {
  id: string;           // Now auto-generated
  imageUrl: string;     // Now with preview
  correctTarget: string; // Now selected from dropdown
  label?: string;       // Optional display label
}

interface DropTarget {
  id: string;              // Now auto-generated
  label: string;           // Required display name
  backgroundColor?: string; // Now with color picker
}
```

### Props Interface
```typescript
interface DragDropPropertyEditorProps {
  properties: DragDropProperties;
  onChange: (newProperties: DragDropProperties) => void;
}
```

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Worksheets
- ‚úÖ **No migration needed** - existing data structure is compatible
- ‚úÖ **Existing activities continue to work** without changes
- ‚úÖ **IDs are preserved** when editing existing activities

### For Developers
```typescript
// Old approach (still works for other components)
<ManualPropertyEditor
  schema={schema}
  properties={properties}
  onChange={onChange}
/>

// New approach (automatic for drag-drop)
// ManualPropertyEditor now routes to DragDropPropertyEditor
// when schema.componentType === 'simple-drag-drop'
```
